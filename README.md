# Carrefour-voyages-strategy
We were assigned to study Carrefour's sales data for 2024-2025 and from this recommend carrefour what it should do to increase its revenue.

We worked on 14 datasets covering the activity of 2024.
- Our main goal was to understand what drives performance, why some agencies do very well, and why others underperform.
  
 -And most importantly: what Carrefour Voyages can do to grow.
  
One thing became clear very quickly:

 -physical agencies are the heart of the business.
 
 -Their sales are very strongly correlated with total revenue.
 
 -The web channel helps, but agencies remain the main growth engine.

## So Our proposed strategy combined hypermarket visibility, loyalty activation, digital lead generation, advisor training, and employee engagement. Together, these levers can significantly increase network revenue.
